#This piece of code will have all basics combined to get started with Python.

# 1. Declaring variables and printing them together.
firstline="Hello Python"
secondline="Hello World"
year=2025
print(firstline +", " + secondline + " " + str(year))


# 2. getting datatypes and conditional booleans.
name = "Aubrey"
age = 21
print(type(name))  
print(isinstance(age, int))



# 3. Simple math.
x=6
y=4

z1=x+y
z2=x*y
z3=x/y
z4=x-y
z5=x**y
z6=x%y
z7=round(x//y,1) #round to 1 decimal place.
